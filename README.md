## Simple Gatsby Resume Template ##

This is meant to hopefully help people who go through the same struggles I went through when building a portfolio web site.
It uses React components to build the site and JSON files to fill in the data. It is based off of [React Resume Template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template)
 but made to work with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
 
**Getting Started**

Copy the template locally
```shell script
# create a new resume template site using the default starter
gatsby new my-resume https://github.com/econnelly/gatsby-resume-template
```

Install dependencies
```shell script
npm install
```

Start server
```shell script
cd my-resume
gatsby develop
```

If everything worked correctly, you should have a server running on `http://localhost:8000`
